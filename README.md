# Expenses Tracker

This is an expenses tracker that allows you to track your expenses and income. It also supports creating recurring expenses/incomes that will be scheduled and create a new expense/income at the specified frequency. In the backend that frequency is specified by a cron expression while the frontend simplifies that to *yearly*, *monthly* or *weekly*.
